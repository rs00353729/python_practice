########### Sequence Types #####################
##### 4. Lists, Tuples & dictioaries ############
#  sequence is the generic term for an ordered set.
# Some sequence classes in python are: lists, tuples, strings
#   and range objects

 '''
Lists
=====
Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together
other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written
as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items
all have the same type.

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

'''


# 4.1 Lists
numbers=[1,2,5]
numbers[2]               # Indexing starts from 0
numbers[2] = 89          # List value is reassigned


# 4.2 Useless list
ul = [ 1, "abc", 23.34, 2, "abc"]
type(ul)



# 4.3 List of methods that apply to list
dir(numbers)	           # numbers.__sizeof__()


# 4.3 Append a number or list to list
#     Append acts to create 'stacks' of lists
#     Append can append an integer or a list
ex=[2,9]
numbers.append(ex)         # Append a list
numbers.append(10)        # Append an integer
numbers

# 4.3.1 Note the difference between
#         append() and extend():

ex = [2,9]
numbers = [6,7,8]
numbers.append(ex)
numbers


# 4.3.2  'extend' merges a list with a list
#        extend() cannot merge an integer with a list
numbers= [6,7,8]
ex = [2,9]
numbers = [6,7,8]
numbers.extend(ex)
numbers

# 4.3.3 This fails
numbers.extend(10)

# 4.3.4 This succeeds
numbers.extend([10])



# 4.4 Popping out from list. Last in first out
numbers.pop()
numbers


# 4.5 Deleting any list item in between
gef = list(range(3,21,2))
gef


# 4.6 What is the index of value 13
gef.index(13)
gef.pop(5)
gef

# 4.6.1  del vs pop

del(gef[5])     # This also works
gef.pop(2:4)    # This does not work
del(gef[2:4])   # This works
gef.pop()       # This works but
                #   there is no equivalence with del




# 4.6.1  Using .remove() without getting its index
gef = list(range(3,21,2))
gef
gef.remove(13)

# 4.7 Iterate over contents of list
#     For iterator vs iterable
#     Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9884132/what-exactly-are-iterator-iterable-and-iteration

result = 0
for i in range(100):           # range(5) is an iterable just as list is
    result += i

# 4.8 Single line for loop
#      Enclosed in square brackets
#       chr(97) is 'a'
#     List comprehension

squares = []
for x in range(10, 20):
    squares.append(x**2)    # squares.extend(x **2) will not work
	                        #  as extend can only extend a list with a list
							#   x**2 is an integer
							#     This will work: squares.extend([x**2])

squares

# 4.81  List comprehension
squares = [x * x for x in range(10, 20)]
squares


# 4.82
squares = [(x,x * x) for x in range(10, 20)]

# 4.83
x=[chr(i) for i in range(97,100) ]
x


# 4.9  Heterogeneous lists
#        But this flexibility comes at a cost: to allow
#         these flexible types, each item in the list must
#          contain its own type info, reference count, and other
#            information–that is, each item is a complete Python object.
 #            It can be much more efficient to store data in a fixed-type array.
 #             For example np.array()
 # https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.01-understanding-data-types.html

del n[:]
n              # n is an empty list
del n          # n is deleted

# 5. Mutating lists
#    What works and what fails
l = list(range(10))
l
l[3] = 10000       # This works
l[2:4] = 10000     # This fails
l[2:4] = [10000] * len(l[2:4])    # This is OK




'''
Tuples
======
A tuple is similar to a list in that it's an ordered
sequence of elements. However, tuples can not be
changed once created (they are "immutable").
Tuples are created by placing comma-separated
values inside parentheses ().
'''

for idx, x in enumerate(zip(t1,t2)):

of objects - keys and values.

Functions
=========

Functions vs Methods
A method refers to a function which is part of a class.
You access it with an instance or object of the class.
A function doesn’t have this restriction: it just refers
to a standalone function. This means that all methods
are functions but not all functions are methods.
